batchScalePTC
=============

Scales a large number of parts in an assembly quickly

**How To**


1. Download the critical scaling mapkey that's included in this github repo.
2. Load it into your Creo session using File > Options > Configuration Editor > Import/Export > OK
3. Opening index.html in the Creo integrated browser, will result in every *.PRT in your current workspace being scaled.

If this is more than just a one time thing, I can add a Windchill-like UI that would allow you to check specific parts.

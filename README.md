batchScalePTC
=============

Scales a large number of parts in an assembly quickly

**How To**


1. Download the critical scaling mapkey that's included in this github repo.
2. Load it into your Creo session using File > Options > Configuration Editor > Import/Export > OK
3. Open the assembly that contains all the components you want to scale (This doesn't work on sub-assemblies).
4. With the assembly activated (Ctrl-A), open index.html in the Creo integrated browser.
